            <h1> Introduction </h1>
            <p> In this simulation, 500,000 particles are animated on each frame, initially forming a cube and quickly transforming into a sphere in an indefinite loop.
            </p>
            <p> Using traditional methods, animating this many particles on each frame would usually cause a drop in frame rate on even modern computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here, however, we're using a method known as GPGPU rendering, or Frame Buffer Output (FBO), which involves saving
                the positions of each particle as a texture, updating that texture in the fragment shader, and then passing that texture 
                as a uniform to the vertex shader. For this to work, we have to render two different scenes.
